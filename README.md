Kubernetes Solo
===============

Setup a Kubernetes Solo environment.

Role Variables
--------------

Variables, right now, are not supported. The main purpose of the role is to setup a local development environment using Vagrant and an Ubuntu VM.

Eventually, more Operating Systems will be supported and, hence, variables will be supported.
